# re-trakt

A simple program to remove all movies from your trakt collection

I guess... to retract them? ðŸ˜‰

> [!WARNING]
> The code is an absolute mess. This was written very quickly to fulfil a need

# Running

```bash
uv sync
uv run re-trakt
```

and follow the steps.

If you have a lot of movies, it can take a while to remove them all due to Trakt rate limits
